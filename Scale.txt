In order to scale to this application to handle more requests per day

* If its not on the cloud (aws, gcp, azure), move this app to cloud first.

* We need scale hardware horizontally as well as vertically.
    Horizontal scaling
    - Having multiple instances of app running on the server.
    - We need load balancer in order to handle this.
    
    Vertical scaling
    - Increasing hardware requirements (memory, cpu)

* Using sql lite for production is not good enough.
  we need more mature database which can be MySql or Postgresql

* We can use redis to save authenticated users. 
  This will save database hit which django performs while checking permissions.

* We can try master slave architecure here.
  This will slower down the create, update, delete queries, 
  but will improve fetching data and fault tolerance of the system.
